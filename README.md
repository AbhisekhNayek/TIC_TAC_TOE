# TIC_TAC_TOE

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 board until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw. The game provides a fun and interactive experience for players of all ages, right in your web browser.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

2. Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. The game will display the empty board, and the first player (X) can make their move.

4. Players will take turns clicking on the available cells to place their X or O.

5. The game will check for valid moves and continue until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

6. If a player wins, the game will display the winner (X or O), and if it's a draw, the game will announce it.

7. To play again, simply refresh the page.
